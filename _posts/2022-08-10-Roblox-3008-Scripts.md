To create a Roblox 3008 script, you first need to open up the Roblox Developer page. From here, you will need to click on the “Create New Script” button. After doing this, you will be brought into the “Script Creation” window.

The first thing that you need to do is name your script. Once you have named your script, you will need to specify what type of script it is.

After providing all of the necessary information, hit the “Create File” button located at the bottom of the window. This will save all of your work in a file named “script-name.roblox” on your computer.
