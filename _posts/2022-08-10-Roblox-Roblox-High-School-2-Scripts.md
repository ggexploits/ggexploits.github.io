First, you will need to get an account on Roblox. Then, you will need to create a new script. When you create your script, you will need to choose a school type. There are four different school types that you can choose from: academic, sports, tech, and rural.

After you have chosen your school type, you will then need to choose a theme. There are many different theme options available on Roblox, but the one that I’ve choosen for this tutorial is the high school theme. After you have chosen your theme, you will next need to choose your characters.

## What Is Roblox High School 2?

Roblox High School 2 is a virtual school that students can attend using their Roblox account. The school offers a variety of courses, including gaming, digital art, music production and more. It's an excellent way for kids to learn new skills and explore different areas of interest.

## Is it safe to have a fire pit on the grass?

Yes you can have a fire pit on the grass! But you shouldn't do it unless you are prepared for the consequences. The fact is, having a fire pit on the grass is highly dangerous and if done incorrectly, you could hurt yourself or even worse, start a fire!

The first thing to think about is your location. The best location for your fire pit would be in an open area- preferably on concrete or pavers. You want to avoid putting your fire pit on dirt because when the wood ashes fall onto the ground, that's where they will stay until they are washed away. If you were to put your fire pit on dirt, the ashes could easily spread and get into the grass. Fire pits should also be far enough away from trees so that your embers don't end up falling onto any branches or leaves that could easily catch on fire.

The next step for safety is purchasing a fire pit that has been elevated off of the ground so that it does not come in contact with any part of your body or clothing. If at all possible, try to purchase a fire pit that allows you to stand directly underneath of it so that if any sparks end up falling they will land directly on the ground instead of hitting you in the face!
