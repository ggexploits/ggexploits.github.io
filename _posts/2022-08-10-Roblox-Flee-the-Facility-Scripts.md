There are a few things you will need to have in order to create your very own butterfly habitat. The most important piece of equipment is a suitable container or box. You will also need some kind of substrate (like moss, bark, etc.), water and food for the butterflies.

To set up your habitat, start by filling the container with enough substrate to cover the bottom of the box. Add a layer of moss or bark on top of that. Then add a few inches of water. Finally, add some flowers that the butterflies can eat from. Leave enough room at the top for the butterflies to fly around and rest.
