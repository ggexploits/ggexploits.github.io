## 1. Introduction
A natural disaster is any event, such as a storm, that causes significant damage to the environment or disrupts normal life. They can be caused by natural phenomena like hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, or by human-made activities like wars and fires.

There are many different types of natural disasters, and each one poses its own unique risks. Some of the most common types of natural disasters include storms, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires.

Some things you can do to prepare for a natural disaster include gathering important documents such as your driver's license and passport, packing a bag with essentials such as food and water, and making sure you have enough money in case you need to evacuate.

During a natural disaster, the most important thing to do is stay safe. Stay inside if possible if the weather is bad outside, avoid walking in floodwaters or standing near active volcanoes, and don't try to fix anything that's broken. If you're injured during a natural disaster, don't attempt to self-medicate; go to an emergency room instead. After a natural disaster has ended, it's important to clean up any messes made and make sure roads are open so people can get back home safely.
