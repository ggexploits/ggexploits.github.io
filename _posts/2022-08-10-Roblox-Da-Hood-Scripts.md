With the right tools, you can create scripts that do everything from changing the colors of your character to making them fly.

To start scripting, first you need to install the Roblox Developer Tools. This can be done by going to the Roblox website and clicking on the “Developer” tab near the top of the page.

This will open up a new script window where you can begin writing your code.

When writing scripts, it is important to keep things simple and organized. Make sure each line of code has a purpose and that it makes sense within the context of the script as a whole. Also, be sure to label your variables so that others reading your script understand what they are responsible for. Finally, remember to test your scripts before deploying them into your game! If everything goes according to plan, then congratulations – you have just created your first scripted item!
