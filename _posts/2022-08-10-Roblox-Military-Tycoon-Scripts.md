## How To Make Sure Your Scripts Are Working Properly.
Scripts can be a great way to get your game up and running quickly, but make sure you are using them correctly. Here are some tips to help make sure your scripts are working properly:

1. Make sure you are opening the right file. If you are opening a script in the editor, make sure you are opening the correct file. There is a "Scripts" folder inside of your game's "Documents" folder.
2. Check your syntax.scripts file for errors. This file is used to check your syntax while you code, and it will error out if there are any errors. If you don't have an error, it's likely that your script is not formatted correctly or there may be something missing from it.
3. Test your scripts! Once you have created your script, it's important to test it before you release it to the public. You can do this by loading it into your game and checking for any errors or glitches. You can also try running the script multiple times to make sure it runs smoothly on different devices and platforms.
4. Use variables carefully. When you create a variable, make sure you use proper naming conventions so that other developers can understand and use your script easily. For example, if you're creating a variable called "playerName", make sure that the name is clearly descriptive and easy to remember. Avoid using complex words or abbreviations, and try to keep variable names as short as possible so that they don't take up too much space in the codebase.
5. Organize your code logically. Try to group related code together so that it is easier to read and follow. Also, keep functions nearby their corresponding variables so that they are more easily accessible.
6. Use comments sparingly! Comments should be used only when necessary, and should only contain information that will help others understand how the code works or why a certain decision was made. Keep comments concise and to the point; excessive commenting can lead to confusion among other developers who may need access to the same code later down the road
