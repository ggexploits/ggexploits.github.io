Last To Leave Scripts works by tracking who has been active in the game the longest and gives them the privilege to leave first. This means that anyone who joins after you will have to wait until the game is over before they can exit.

This script is great for preventing low-level players from spamming the game with their character while everyone else is trying to play. It’s also a great way to keep players from cheating or attacking other players while they are offline. So if you ever find yourself needing to leave a game early, be sure to check out Last To Leave Scripts!
