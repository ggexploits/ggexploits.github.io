## 1. How To Get The Roblox Rocket Tester Scripts

If you want to use the Roblox Rocket Tester scripts, there are a few things you need to do first. First you need to get the scripts. You can find them on the Roblox website under the "Developers" section. Once you have the scripts, you can start using them.

To use the Roblox Rocket Tester scripts, you need to open them up in a text editor like Microsoft Word or Notepad. Once you have opened the scripts, you will see three main sections: The Test Case Scripts, The Input Files and The Output Files.

The Test Case Scripts are where you put your test cases. Each test case is a set of instructions that tells the script what to do and how to measure the results. You will need at least one test case for each parameter that you want to measure.

The Input Files are where you put all the data that you want to measure. You will need at least one input file for each parameter that you want to measure. The input files can be any type of file that has data in it, such as an Excel spreadsheet or a text file.

The Output Files are where you will get the results of your tests. You will need at least one output file for each parameter that you have measured. The output files can be any type of file, but they must be in a specific format (.xlsx or .txt).

Once you have created your test cases and input files, it is time to start testing your script! To test your script, first run it by clicking on the "Run" button on the toolbar above the text editor window. This will launch your script in debug mode so that you can see how it works. Then select one of your test cases from among the test cases that are listed in the Test Case Scripts section and click on the "Run" button again. This will run your test case and start measuring its results.

As soon as your test case finishes running, you will see a list of statistics in the Output Files section of your script window. This list includes information about how long your test took, how many times it crashed during testing and how many errors were found in your code. If there is something wrong with one of your tests or if you want to change something in your script, then now is a good time to do so! Otherwise, save your changes and close out your script
