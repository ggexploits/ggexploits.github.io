Butterflies are insects that use their wings to fly. They have two pairs of wings, which they use to fly around. Butterflies also have a long tongue called a proboscis that they can curl up like a straw and use to suck up nectar from flowers. These insects are mainly restricted to a liquid diet. The proboscis is an adaptation that helps butterflies drink the sugary liquid; they don't have any teeth or jaws to chew their food.
