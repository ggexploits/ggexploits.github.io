If you spend any amount of time playing Roblox, then you know that it can be a lot of fun to make your own games. But making these games by yourself can be challenging, which is why we created this freeze tag script.

This script allows you to create games with other players automatically, which makes gaming much more fun and efficient. So if you are looking for a way to add some excitement and complexity to your games, then this is the script for you!

## What Is Freeze Tag?

Freeze tag is a game where players tag each other with freeze tags. The object of the game is to avoid being tagged by the other team and to collect as many freeze tags as possible. When someone is tagged, they must put their hand over their mouth and scream “freeze tag”. The person who tags them then has to freeze them for two minutes. If a player gets tagged three times in a row, they are out of the game.

## How Do You Play Freeze Tag?

To play freeze tag, you and your friends need to get together and sign up online. Once you're all registered, you will be able to join any of the available games. To start the game, each player needs to go find an opponent and touch them. If you're tagged, you will be frozen for a set amount of time (usually about 30 seconds). This allows other players to take shots at you and eventually knock you out! Be careful though- if someone tags you while you are frozen, it's game over!

## What Are Some Variations Of Freeze Tag?
There are a few variations of Freeze Tag that you can play on Roblox. These variations include:
## -Tag Duel
## -Tag War
## -Freeze Tag Race
## -Tag Team
## -Team Deathmatch

## How Can You Make A Freeze Tag Game In Roblox?

To make a freeze tag game in Roblox, you'll first need to create a map. You can either create the map yourself or use someone else's map. Once you have your map created, you'll need to designate different areas for your players to go. For example, one player might be designated as the "captain" and the other players might be designated as "taggers." The captain will then need to choose some objects or places on the map that they want to be tagged. The taggers then need to go around the captain and try to tag them by touching them with their hands or feet. If a tagger successfully tags the captain, they become the new captain and the process starts over from scratch.

## What Scripts Do You Need For A Freeze Tag Game In Roblox?
In order to play a freeze tag game in Roblox, you will need the following scripts: 
## - Tag
## - Freeze
## - High Five

## How Do You Put The Scripts Together To Make A Game?
To make a game, you will need to first create a project in Roblox. This will be where you save your game files and can access them from any computer that has the Roblox player installed. Once you have created your project, you will then need to create a script. A script is just a collection of code that makes your game work. To create your first script, go to the Script Editor and click on New Script. 

Once you have created your script, you will need to start coding. The first thing you will need to do is create an object. An object is basically a piece of code that you can use in your script to control something in the game. To create an object, click on the Objects tab and then select New Object. 

Next, you will need to add a function to your script. A function is a set of instructions that allow you to do something specific in your game. To add a function, click on the Functions tab and then select New Function. 

After you have added the function, you will need to give it a name and description. Next, you will need to define what type of function it is. Functions can be simple or complex; this depends on how detailed your explanation for the function is. In this example, we are going to create a simple function that prints out the text “Hello World!” To do this, click on the Text tab and then select New Text Node. 

## After you have created the text node, type in the following code:



## print("Hello World!");



Now that we have created our function, we need to call it from our script. To do this, go back to the Script Editor and double-click on Your_Script_Name_here.js in the project folder. This will open up Your_Script_Name_here.js in the editor window. Next, paste in the following line at the bottom of Your_Script_Name_here.js:



function HelloWorld() { ## print("Hello World!"); }


Now that we have called our function, we need to test it out by clicking on Run in the top left corner of the editor window (or press F5). This should output “Hello World!” onto your screen each time you run your game.
