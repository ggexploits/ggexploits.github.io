Once you've found a few scripts that interest you, it's time to get started using them. First, make sure that you have the latest version of Roblox installed on your computer. Next, open up the script in a text editor, such as Notepad or Microsoft Word. Once the script is open, make sure that all of the settings are correct. If there are any errors, they will show up in the text editor. Finally, click OK to save the script and exit the editor.

Now it's time to put the script into action in Roblox. To do this, first find a place in the game where you want to use the script. Next, go into your Character Options and select "Load Script".
