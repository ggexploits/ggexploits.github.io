Once you've found a victim, press [W] to start swimming towards them. If they are close enough, your shark will lunge forward and try to eat them. Be careful not to hit any obstacles while eating someone; if you do, your shark will stop and you'll have to start over. Keep eating victims until they reach the ship at the bottom of the screen; then quickly swim back up to safety before they climb onto the ship and escape!
