## How To Use Roblox Fashion Show Scripts

If you want to put on a Roblox fashion show, there are a few things you need to do first. First, you will need to create a scene and add some models. You can find the models in the Model Viewer or by typing "model" into the Chat Box and clicking on the model that you want to use. You can also use scripts to create your models. To create a script model, open Scripts and click on the "Create Script Model" button. This will open the Create Script Model dialogue box.

This will open the Show dialog box with all of your scenes loaded. Next, select one of your scenes and click on the Add Models button. This will open the Add Models dialogue box where you can add any models that you want to use in your scene. You can also add scripts to your scene using this dialogue box. Once you have added all of your models and scripts, click on OK to close the dialogue boxes and save your show.

Now it's time to test your show! To test your show, click on File > Run Show… This will open the Run Show dialog box where you can specify which scene should be run as a demo (by default, it is scene 1). Click on OK to run your show and watch how your models interact with each other!
