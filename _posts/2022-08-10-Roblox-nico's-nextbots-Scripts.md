## How To Make A Nextbot In Roblox

To make a nextbot, you first need to create a character in Roblox. You can do this by clicking on the Create Character button on the main screen of the game.

There are four different types of nextbots: soldier, engineer, medic and scientist.

Next, it is important to select your nextbot's abilities. Your nextbot's abilities will determine what kind of tasks it can perform. For example, an engineer nextbot can build tools and machines, while a medic nextbot can heal people. You will also need to decide which weapons your nextbot will use. Mostnextbots come with weapons already built into them, but you may want to add additional weapons if you plan on using your robot in combat situations.

After you have selected your abilities and chosen your weapons, it is time to choose your robot's stats. Stats play an important role in determining how well your nextbot performs during missions. You should carefully consider each stat before deciding on its value. The stats that you should focus on most include strength, speed, health and energy.

 Finally, it is time to create your mission for your nextbot. A mission is a set task that your robot must complete in order to succeed. This task might involve travelling through dangerous territory or fighting off enemies armed with deadly technology. Once you have created your mission, click on the Play button to start playing it immediately!
