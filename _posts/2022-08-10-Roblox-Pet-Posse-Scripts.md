## What are Pet Posse scripts?
Pet posse scripts are programs that allow users to control the actions of other players in their games. They allow users to run different commands on behalf of other players, including spawning objects, controlling characters, and determining player movement. Popular Pet Posse scripts include cheat codes, game mods, and tools for creating levels or puzzles.

## How do you use them?
To use a Pet Posse script, first you need to find it. You can find them on the Roblox website under the "Scripts" category or by using the search engine on Roblox. Once you've found a script, you will need to download it. To download a script, click on the blue "Download" button next to the title of the script. Once you have downloaded the script, you will need to unzip it if it is a .rar file. After you have unzipped the file, you will need to copy all of the files inside of it into your Roblox game folder. For example, if the script is called "MyScript," you would copy MyScript-1.js, MyScript-2.js, and MyScript-3.js into your Scripts folder in your Roblox game.

After you have copied all of the files into your game folder, you will need to add a reference to the files inside of the zip file in your Scripts section of yourgame properties page (found in your profile). To do this, open up your Game Properties page (found in your profile), and click on the "Scripts" tab at the top of the page. Next, click on the blue "Add Script" button next to MyScript-1.js and select the zip file that contains all of the files from step #9. After selecting the zip file, click on OK to add it to your list of scripts and close out of Game Properties Page. Now every time you load MyScript-1.js in your game, Roblox will automatically load all three files that were added from step #9 into memory so that you can start playing around with its contents right away!
